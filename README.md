This is our project from the http://hacknc.us/ hackathon, 2014.  

It's a Pebble application which will get the public buses currently around you using the NextBus service, and display their arrival time, stop, and direction.  So far, it's just a very very rough prototype.  Things to fix:

- get actual gps coords and get buses close to them
- fix the back button for the main screen
- add a loading screen for getting buses
- implement other menu items
